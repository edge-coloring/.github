# External programs and files for the proof of three-edge-coloring projective planar/toroidal cubic graphs

This organization `edge-coloring` contains the programs and files used to validate the proof in
1.  "Three-edge-coloring projective planar cubic graphs" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16586)), or
2.  "Three-edge-coloring (Tait coloring) cubic graphs on the torus: A proof of Gr√ºnbaum's conjecture" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07002))
